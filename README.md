# Unity 2D Controllers

This repository 2D controllers using Unity's Cinemachine.

## Main features

### TranslateTargetMovementController

This is a simple free move controller.

It consist in moving a target, using legacy axis sytem, and following the target using a Cinemachine virtual camera.

## Running the project

To run the project, open one of the scenes, and use Azerty usual movement keys to move, or the arrows.

## Importing the project

You can add this package as a git url :

- "https://github.com/isirode/Unity2DControllers.git?path=/Assets/Isirode/Unity2DControllers#0.0.1".

The project will be added to your "Packages" folder, the scenes will be read-only, if you want to open them, just copy them in your Assets folder and they will be usable.

You can also download the .unitypackage of the version you want, here for instance https://github.com/isirode/Unity2DControllers/releases/tag/0.0.1 and add it manually to your project. This should import the project in your Assets folder.

## Know issues

I am not sure wether or not the virtual camera setting is optimal.
